This Repository is created after the RED-DAY topic at 15.03.2024.

Map motions to an avatar instead of a real person can help any one to create exercise and seem a-like. It can multiplies the number of created exercise.

I found [Mannequins.js](https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js) which is a human figure representation with the real human limitations. Also, found [PoseNet](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/posenet)
which uses a trained model to identify human figure using a simple camera (webcam).

In this repository, I tried to join them together so it can represent a human figure controllable by a real human movements.
Currently, it support the head movement based on the Eye detections.
